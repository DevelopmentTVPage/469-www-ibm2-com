The 83mm waist is not considered a fat ski, but will give you support and float off piste. A Full Wood Core in the Myriad will give you liveliness and power as you make your way down the mountain. Salomon's Hook Free Taper makes the Myriad highly maneuverable and very easy to control, and it will not get caught up in the bumps, crud and powder. The Utility Rocker has rocker in the tip to keep you floating and stable in the good stuff; with a slight camber underfoot to still give you grip on the snow when you fell like staying inbounds. If you are ready to start to ski in places you never have before the new Salomon Myriad will be ready for you.",
