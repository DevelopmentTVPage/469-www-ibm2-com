This deck is an aggressive, yet surfy twin built for hitting features and locking in landings. All mountain freestyle chargers will enjoy the new Hybrid LowRize rocker shape designed with the playful LowRize rocker in the tip and tail and a micro-camber zone between the feet for easy handling and ultra response. To go along with Hybrid LowRize the Machete GT has the all new Popwalls which give you the smooth ride of Slimewalls and maximum response, grip, and stability by adding carbon to the outside edge of the board. This is the playful all-mountain freestyle deck for those that demand more out of their board.",
