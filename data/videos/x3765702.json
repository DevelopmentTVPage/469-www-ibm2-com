At 78mm underfoot the Cheyenne loves to make short to medium radius turns at medium to fast speeds on the groomers. Vertical Sidewalls will give you a strong edge hold on the firm snow, and even ice. Made with Blizzard's Flipcore 3D Rocker the rocker in the tip will initiate turns quickly and easily for you, while the camber underfoot will give you a consistent grip as you slice your way down the mountain. Flipcore 3D Rocker is made by placing the wood for the core of the ski in the press upside down so it maintains a lively, springy feeling, without being broken. If you are looking for a ski that will carve down the groomers, and have plenty of power when things can get a little bumpy, the Blizzard Cheyenne will be a great ski for you.",
