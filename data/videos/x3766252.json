At 92mm underfoot the Sassy 7 has the waist width to give the intermediate skiers ample float and stability in the soft snow, yet still be a fun ski on the groomers. Loaded with game improvement features for the powder this sassy lass has a spoon tip that is less hooky, and will help you steer towards the untouched. The Powder turn rocker has camber underfoot for power, and control on the hard pack, while the rocker in the tip and tail keep the ski on top of the snow, absorb negative vibrations from crud, and engage the tip of the ski quicker at the beginning of a turn. The Powder Turn Rocker has been proven to work great in all areas of the mountain. The Fiberglass and wood core, with a RossiTop Cap construction keep the skis flex right where it needs to be for the adventures that an intermediate might experience when they start to go off trail. If you are looking for adventure and a ski to get off the groomers with the Rossignol Sassy 7 wont give you any back talk.",
