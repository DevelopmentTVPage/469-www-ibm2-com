At 87mm at the waist the Panic can handle anything you may encounter like crud, bumps, firm snow, and light powder. Atomic's Progressive Twin Sidecut makes this a very well rounded ski by having a longer radius in the tip that will dive you into turns quickly, and a shorter radius in the tail to give you grip and mobility at the end of your turns. The Panic uses Atomic's Backbone Technology that has a carbon backbone inlayed over the wood core for stability and pop, without adding any extra weight to your skis. The Step Down Sidewall Construction has cap construction on the tips and tails to enable the Panic to flex easy, and have lots of maneuverability, while the sidewall underfoot will give you a strong edge hold on the snow. All Mountain Rocker will have you ready for anything on the mountain. If you are an intermediate skier who is looking for a versatile ski at a great price, the Atomic Panic will chill you out.",
