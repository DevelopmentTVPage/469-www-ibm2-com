At 105mm underfoot you can float and smear with the best of them. Salomon has a Honeycomb Tip and a Hook Free Taper on the Q-105 that makes the ski very maneuverable and not feel hooked up in the deep snow and bumps. The Full Wood Core has the power to take on the variable snow conditions when you haven't gotten any snow in a few days. Utility Rocker has rocker in the tip to keep you on top of the snow, with camber underfoot to give you edge hold on the firm snow. If you are looking for a ski that will be great in the off trail terrain, and still be able to get you to the steep stuff by way of a groomer, the Salomon Q-105 will be a great ski for you.",
