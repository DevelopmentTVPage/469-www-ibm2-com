The All-Mountain rocker on the Outland 87 has a moderate tip and tail rocker that allows easier turn initiation and soft snow performance. The rocker also provides full-length sidecut engagement for powerful and confident edge grip so you can absolutely slay the mountain in its entirety. Thicker core profile at edges from the 3D wood core construction provides powerful grip and energy transmission so the ski feels like an extension of your legs. A Milled center reduces weight, improving versatility and control. Super Fiber laminates deliver vibration-free stability and strong, full-length edge grip for enhanced carving on groomers. Autodrive is a blend of vertical sidewall and cap constructions for superior edge hold and features vertical sidewalls underfoot to provide increased power and edge grip. The cap construction toward tip and tail allows less aggressive turn entry and exit so you can ride easy while you ski hard.",
