The Inspire's best feature is the Amphibio Rocker that has a rockered outside edge on the tips of the skis and camber on the inside edge to give you a ski that is extremely easy to turn, but you still get the stability and edge hold of a high powered cambered ski. The Inspire also is made with Elan's Waveflex Technology that has waves built into the structure of the ski to give you a deep even flex, high torsional strength, and awesome carving power. RST Sidewalls hold a strong edge on the snow, and deliver power directly to the edge of the ski for smooth and clean carves on the groomers. A Dualite Wood Core has a very damp feeling making the Inspire one of the cleanest carving skis for women today. If you enjoy making short to medium radius turns down the groomers at medium to fast speeds the Elan Inspire will not disappoint you.",
