The Amphibio rocker profile has one rockered edge on the outside of the ski, and a cambered edge on the inside of the ski. You can get the benefits of both rocker and camber in one ski. Rocker on the outside helps the ski hook up and turn easy, and the camber gives a powerful edge grip, you get a ski that is easy to turn and delivers powerful edge hold and quick turning. The Waveflex zone on the shovel of the ski gives the ski an easy longitudinal flex, that helps you carve, and turn with ease, while still having a stiff torsional flex for stability and control, making the Amphibio Waveflex 12 a really easy ski to carve both short quick turns, and long powerful turns. RST Sidewalls to give you strong edge hold on the firm snow or even ice. ABS material above the edges gives you direct power transmission to the edge of the ski that helps you accelerate out of your turns. The Laminated Wood Core, along with a single layer of titanium is specialty shaped to the individual size of each ski has a powerful feel, and a high torsional strength. The new Fusion binding system is 15% lighter than before, and is free flexing, so the binding can move independently of the ski giving you more control.",
