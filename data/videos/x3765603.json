At 87mm underfoot you can carve up the groomers, and have a ski that will help you improve your off trail skiing. The Supreme is made with a wood core that has Atomic's Carbon Backbone Construction that is inlayed onto the ski for a very lively and stable feeling, without adding any extra weight. The Supreme has a Twin Progressive Sidecut that has a larger radius at the tip and a smaller radius in the tail that will give you an easier turn initiation, with grip and stability out of your turns. Step Down Sidewalls give you a very maneuverable ski in the tips and tails, but the vertical sidewall underfoot will give you a firm edge on the snow. The Supreme has All Mountain Rocker that has tip rocker to keep you on top of the snow, camber underfoot for edge hold on the snow, and slight rocker in the tail to release you out of turns very easily. If you want a ski that has a very light and snappy feeling to it the Atomic Supreme will be your baby.",
