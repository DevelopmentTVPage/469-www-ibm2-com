The Burton Lip-Stick snowboard is fast and loose thanks to the Flat Top profile. The flat profile between the feet means you're going to feel super stable, balanced, and have superb edge control. The early kick-ups in the tips outside the feet provide the loose feeling and float that you'd expect from a rocker. Jumper Cables will help you boost to Jupiter with a single olly. Frostbite Edges underfoot give you plenty of grip for those icy park laps. Ellip kicks enhance float so you can get surfy on the pow pow. Pro-Tip tip taper makes spinning for days as easy as petting a panda cub. You know how snowboards have a break-in period? Not the Burton Lip-Stick! Thanks to Infinite Ride, the Lip-Stick will ride the same from day 1 to day 100. We think your local mountain needs some Lip-Stick.",
