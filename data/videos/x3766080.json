Salomon's Powder Rocker is maneuverable in the trees and stable when you are flashing lines down an empty wide open bowl. A full wood core with a Honey Comb tip and tail make the Rocker 2 108 light, and stable. The Edge Free Extremities ensure you will not catch the snow and give you smoother floatation in powder. Wider edges, and total edge reinforcement are a must for added durability to reduce the chances of blowing an edge out when the cheese grater andicite is buried under a layer of the fresh stuff. When first tram is the norm, not a special occasion have the Salomon Rocker 2 108 on your feet.",
