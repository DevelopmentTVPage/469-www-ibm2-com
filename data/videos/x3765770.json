If your perfect run is some freshly groomed corduroy with a steep pitch to it, this is your ski.

SST Sidewalls are slanted to give you strong edge hold on even the iciest conditions, but also help the 82 Xti drop some weight. The Force Wood Core with and XTi layer is very powerful, making it perfect for short to medium radius arcs down the front side. Elan's Waveflex Technology has waves across the top sheet of the ski to give it a natural flex, high torsional stiffness and make it the ultimate carving machine.
