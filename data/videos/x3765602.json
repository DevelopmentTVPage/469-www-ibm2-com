The 78mm waist is great for carving short to medium radius turns, but can handle light powder, and the Belle to Belle is very maneuverable in bump skiing. Nordica's women's specific i-Core has vertically laminated wood that keeps the weight of the ski low, but the Belle to Belle is very stable at medium to fast speeds, and it has a very snappy feeling throughout your turns. Nordica's All Mountain camRock Rocker Profile has camber on most of the ski that will give you a firm and deliberate edge on the snow, with rocker in the tip that will initiate turns quickly and absorb vibrations from bumpy snow, so you will have a smoother ride. Vertical Sidewalls will give you a fantastic grip on the snow, and improve you edge hold if it gets icy. If you are one of those gals that loves to be out all day, and enjoys a snappy feeling on short to medium turns the Nordica Belle to Belle will be a very fun ride for you.",
