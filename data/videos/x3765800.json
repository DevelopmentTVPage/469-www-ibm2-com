It is an intoxicating ride for those big time all mountain chargers. New this year are the Popwalls which give you the smooth ride of Slimewalls and maximum response, grip, and stability by adding carbon to the outside edge of the board. The Highlife UL also features the Hybrid All Mountain rocker shape which gives you a loose playful rocker in the tip, giving you a board that is easy to send into a turn and then an ultra grippy, stable micro camber zone under foot all the way to the tail. This board comes complete with all the UL techs, an ultra-light urethane Membrain top sheet and Carbon Array 5, so it has got that going for it which is nice. This deck is truly an all mountain masterpiece that rides effortlessly in pow, is fun cruising with your lady friend on the groomers or maching laps a warp speed.",
