An 98mm waist is wide enough for you to spend most of your time off pieste, but can still rip the groomers up. The Line Metal Matrix gives the 98 tons of torsional and lateral stiffness without adding the weight that skis that have edge to edge metal do. 63mm of Early Rise in the tip will help this ski float in the pow, smooth out your ride in the crud, and turn quickly on the groomers. Early Rise in the tail will help you smear your turns and dump speed when it is time to point it off of a drop. Line's Fatty Base Edge is a 30% thicker base that will make it harder for you put a core shot on your bases, even over the nastiest cheese grater rock, and increase the tuning life of your ski. The 5Cut Side Cut has five different sizes of side cut to give you the ability to vary you turn sizes and shapes with ease. If you are not afraid to ski a 98mm wasted ski on the groomers and spend most of your time in the ungroomed stuff the Line Prophet 98 is a solid choice.",
