Made with Graphene which is an ultra light and very strong material that allows your skis to flex easily, and make them very responsive when the slightest amount of pressure is put on them. The Pure Joy has a women's specific camber that has a lower profile to make it easier for you to not only turn, but transfer your energy from ski to ski. The composite core combined with the Power Sidewall Jacket make the Pure Joy light and forgiving, but it will hold a solid edge on the snow. Head's Allride Rocker Profile will help you start to carve your turns instead of skidding them very quickly. If you are a beginner or recreational skier that wants a ski to be light and forgiving the Head Pure Joy will give you a joyful experience on the slopes.",
