The Active Camber has plenty of spring and pop for boosting on rails or boxes, and will give you lots of control on the groomers. The Resist Edge has added durability to take some of the punishment that you will dish out to this Trooper in the park. The Cap Fiber core is very lightweight and forgiving, so you do not need to put a lot of energy or force into the ski to make it respond. The nearly symmetrical shape makes the Trooper very easy to lean your switch skiing or landing skills either in the park or the urban rail set up. If you are looking for an inexpensive park ski the Atomic Trooper will be your soldier.",
