Mid-Wide twin shape allows any size foot to step up to the plate. BTX combines Banana Technology with Magnetraction to give riders higher Ollies, deeper presses and unmatched edge hold in all situations. If the only action you get this year is busting your lip off the ledge behind your local school then this is the board for you. The GNU Street Series kills it in your urban scene and on the mountain, so feel free to but away the bungee and go score yourself a lift ticket.",
