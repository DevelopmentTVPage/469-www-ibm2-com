Volkl's Power\/Tough Box Construction with a Multi-Layer Sensorwood Core has the spring and pop you need to boost out of the pipe, or on to any feature or rail you see. The Ledge's symmetrical flex and shape are Jibber Joe's dream, for butters and huge switch landings. If you are looking for an economically price twin, that has power and pop to it, the Volkl Ledge will be a great ski for you.",
