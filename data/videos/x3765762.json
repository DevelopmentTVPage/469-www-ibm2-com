Early Rise Rocker has rocker in the tip to absorb vibrations when the snow can get bumpy and initiate turns quicker. Camber underfoot will keep you stable and engaged into your turns on the groomers. The Black Magic has Elan's Waveflex Technology that has waves in the mid body of the ski that enable it to flex consistently, lower the total weight of the ski, and give the Black Magic a strong torsional strength. The Black Magic has a Dualite Wood Core with Layers of Fiberglass that has a healthy mix of forgiveness, and snap to it to give you a very lively ski that enjoys making medium to short radius turns on the groomed trails. If you want a ski that has a simple look to it that will be great for the beginner to intermediate skier the Elan Black Magic is a perfect ski.",
