Built with a stiffer flex, Columbian Gold Core and aggressive C2 Power Banana\/Camber Combo; the Lib Tech Skunk Ape C2BTX Wide Snowboard rips through powder with baboon strength and increased pop like you have never seen before. The C2 Banana Rocker combination offers the best features of Banana Tech with rocker between your feet blended with a radial camber to contact points. This focuses pressure between your feet for easy turns, great edge hold on ice and max pressure to the tails for power end-to-end stability pop and control for float in powder in both directions, carving on hardpack and ice and a catch-free freestyle performance. The Skunk Ape has evolved into a big-foot, snow slaying monster of awesome.",
