Will thats exactly what happened to The Holy Moly II this year. Featuring Grand Pops, which was introduced in the Honey Pot last year, and it prevailed. Grand Pops increases the pop zones by flatting out the contact points just inside the nose and tail. This creates a larger platform for a much bigger ollie. Added to the Holy Moly II are Car Bombs Carbon Booms which are solid carbon inlayed into the tip and tail for even more snap and boom. Oh but the ollie isn't done their, with a carbon fiber blend laminate the Holy Moly II will win every single ollie contest around. Once again the engineers at Forum have out done themselves.",
