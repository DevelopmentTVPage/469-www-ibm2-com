The Viola has tip rocker to help you initiate turns faster than ever, while camber underfoot gives you a solid hold on the snow. At 74mm underfoot the Viola is very nimble edge to edge and excels in making short to medium radius turns. Volkl's Bio-Logic Construction address some women's specific needs in skis such as having a softer flex, more level stance, and a narrower tail shape to give you more control over your skis, and require you to use less energy while skiing, for one spectacular day on the mountains. The Viola's XTD Transmission Construction along with a Dual Wood Core has strength and power on your high speed turns, and more stability the faster you go. If you are looking for a ski that can handle a variety of speeds, and smooth carves, the Volkl Viola will be a great ski for you.",
