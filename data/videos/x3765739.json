At 88mm underfoot you get the perfect balance for a ski that will still be edgy and quick to ski on the groomers and be able to get into the trees, bowls and powder when the snow starts flying. Salomon's Utility Rocker is great for any condition the mountains will throw at it. Tip rocker will keep you on top of the snow and initiate turns quickly for you, camber underfoot will keep you stable and grip the trails, while the small amount of rocker in the tail will release you out of turns easily, and give you a slight smear in the deep. A Full Wood Core of the Lux is very lively when you want to make quick, short turns, and has just enough power to bust up crud when it has not snowed in a few days. A Hook Free Taper only makes the Q-88 even more maneuverable. If you are looking for a ski that will enjoy whatever you can get into the Salomon Q-88 Lux is the ski for you.",
