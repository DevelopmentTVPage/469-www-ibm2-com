At 96mm underfoot you get a ski that is happy anywhere you can take it. This Full Wood Core ski has the ability to power through deep snow, bumps and crud, without being too heavy it will cause you to fatigue quickly. The Honeycomb Tip reduces the overall weight of the ski, helps it float better in pow, and makes it more maneuverable. Salomon's Utility Rocker has rocker in the tip to keep you on top of all of the deep snow you are going to be skiing, slight camber underfoot to still drive a tough edge on the firm snow, and rocker in the tail to give you smearability. If you want a ski that excels in the soft snow, but will be a great ski to take everywhere the Salomon Q-96 Lumen is a ski for you to own.",
