So wether your considering buying either the stock or the car this is a must see. I truly came back believing that this car performed better than any other gas powered car in its class. I think the key to this unique drive is the low center of gravity that gives a grip that no combustion engine car can physically achieve.\n\n\nWhen I bought AAPL apple the day Steve Jobs got rehired in 1997 at 4 buck equivalent and accumulated, back then everyone and there mom bashed the company, look at it now. Im a full time stock and options trader, yet all my trading trough the years has\ufeff not made me as much money as holding on to AAPL stock from 4 buck equivalent after stock splits. I feel about TSLA today as I felt about AAPL back then. Time will tell if I'm right",
