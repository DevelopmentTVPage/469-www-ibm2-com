The B-Street was one of top tested boards for both genders by Snowboarding Magazine this year. I do not blame guys for riding this board with its aggressive BTX this board still has lots of pop and the flexibility of a jib board while maintaining the ability to surf the pow. Throw Magnetraction into the mix and behold a snowboard that will have the most amazing edge hold on the mountain. The GNU B-Street is such a fun banana it will change the way you perceive the mountain whether being a beginner or a crafty veteran.",
