The Forum Recon is the foundation of Forums snowboards and there is a reason for that. It does not matter if you have been riding for 15 years or this is our first year the Forum recon has everything you need at an amazing price to keep you happy on the hill. The Recon has the famous Chillydog with Pop rocker for fluid fun and float. The recon leaves kickers and rails in ruins with a stiffer tail that allows for a snappier pop. The Recon will make any freestyle park rider happy and any freestyle all-mountain rider overjoyed when they put this under their feet.",
