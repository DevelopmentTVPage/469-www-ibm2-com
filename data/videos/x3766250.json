The Magnum 8.5Ti uses Blizzards Spaceframe 3D construction that has a Titanal topsheet, but not full edge to edge, so you have a powerful ski that has a lighter swing weight, with a smoother flex, and a strong torsional strength without adding extra weight. The Flipcore 3D Technology has a natural bend to it so the wood core is not bent or broken, so the flex stays consistent, for great stability, perfect edge pressure distribution, and ultimate control over your ski. The slight rocker in the tip and tail gives the Magnum 8.5Ti the great ability to keep the ski locked in perfect arcs when the ski is put on edge. The 85 mm waist will crush any crud that is in its path, and give you some floatation when you get off the trial into some powder. If you like a ski that turns on a dime and lays perfect trenches like railroad tracks the Blizzard Magnum 8.5 Ti is the ski for you.",
