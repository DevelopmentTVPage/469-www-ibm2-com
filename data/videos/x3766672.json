With camber sections under your feet for power and pop and rocker between the bindings and in the nose and tail, the DoubleDog with Pop profile makes for a forgiving, park-slaying ride. Newly added Car Bombs elevates ollies and takes your game to the next level of freestyle by adding two fiberglass inlays running from the tip and tail and stopping just outside your bindings. To further pump up your park experience, Swinger's Club will help save weight without sacrificing durability. From heavy-metal kinks to massive kickers, you've got the power and playfulness only a Destroyer DoubleDog can deliver. Destroy the ordinary and set your own rules.",
