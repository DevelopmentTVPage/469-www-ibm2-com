The RTM 77 is made with Volkl's Dual Wood Core that has parallel strips of wood that are surrounded by PU that has a stiff feeling, and the PU adds some dampening properties to give you a smooth skiing ski. The XTD Transmission Construction has some reinforcement over the edges of the skis to still give you power transmission, and flex to the body of the ski. A layer of steel above the Dual wood core increases the torsional power that makes the RTM 77 a great ski for the heavier or more aggressive skier. A Full Rocker profile gives you quick turn initiation, and solid grip as you make your carves down the groomers. If you are looking for a ski that will be stable on the firm snow, and quick to turn on the groomers, the Volkl RTM 77 will be a fantastic choice.",
