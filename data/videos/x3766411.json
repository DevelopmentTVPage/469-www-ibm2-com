The new Nollie-Flex Core has lots of pop, and spring to it, so you can be getting higher with every jump. The traditional camber will help you slay any urban sessions, and the 2.2mm steel edges have plenty of room for you to de-tune them down to nothing. Icelantic has a new Carbonium Topsheet that is more durable than ever before. If you are looking for a park ski that you can jib all season long, nollie, or ollie over anything you see, get the Icelantic Da Nollie.",
