Since its release the Kendo has been a high powered ski for aggressive experts that will spend most of their time making long to medium radius turns on steep, and fast groomers. This season Volkl added some tip rocker, while keeping camber under foot to this groomer killer to increase some maneuverability and versatility. The Sensorwood core has laminated beech and poplar wood for a very damp and powerful feel. The Kendo also gained one millimeter underfoot for a slightly longer turning radius. Full vertical sidewalls only give the Kendo better edge grip on the firm snow and ice. A layer of Titanium is added to the Sensorwood core for unmatched lateral and torsional strength. The Kendo is best suited for heavy or aggressive skiers that enjoy German precision, that will spend most of their time digging trenches in the corduroy, going ultra fast, dabbling in the trees, powder when the snow is good and getting warnings to slow down by the red coats.",
