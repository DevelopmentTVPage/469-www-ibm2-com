The Sandwich Sidewall Construction gives the Motive 76 strong torsional strength, and great edge grip on the ice or firm snow. A wood core has a very lively feel that makes it very easy for you to snap quick turns. The Carbon Tech Construction has a network of carbon fibers that have a strong torsional strength, and a balanced stiffness pattern, to give you a ski that will flex longitudinally, while still being stiff torsionally. The 17m (@175cm) turning radius makes perfect medium arcs down a wide open groomer. If you still like your skis to be skinny at the waist, and want some power behind them, the Fischer Motive 76 will be a great choice for you.",
