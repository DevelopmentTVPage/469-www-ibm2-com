The Hybrid Double Zone is sandwiched in between two layers of titanal, combined that with a Laminate Matrix you get a ski that has a powerful and damp feeling that is very stable and unshakeable at high speeds. The AR Nose Rocker will initiate your turns very quickly and smoothly to make the ARVti highly responsive, and it float well up to a really deep pow day. A Comp Series Base is the fastest that Armada produces so you will be hauling ass down the mountain. With a 98mm waist the ARVti is a true all mountain tool that aggressive, fast skiers will love both on the groomers and seeking out your own adventure anywhere else on the mountain. If you want an Armada ski that has backbone, power, and all mountain versatility the ARVti is a one of a kind ski for you.",
