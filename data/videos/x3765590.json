At 100mm underfoot the NRGy 100 can do just about anything you want on the mountain, on trail or off. Nordica's i-Core Torsion Bridge Ti Construction has vertically laminated wood that has a playful, snappy feeling. The Ti Bridge has strategically placed titanium that adds power and responsiveness, but will not add excess weight to make you fatigue to easily. The All Mountain camRock has tip rocker to keep you on top of the snow, initiate turns quickly, and absorb vibrations caused by bumps or crud. Camber underfoot will provide you with rebound and edge hold, especially at fast speeds. The NRGy 100's flared tail releases you out of a turn effortlessly, and makes it very maneuverable in bumps, trees and other tight spots. If you are looking for a ski that will charge in any snow condition, or any run on the mountain do you have the energy for the Nordica NRGy 100?",
