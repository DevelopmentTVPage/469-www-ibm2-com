The Exclusive Balance System employs specific stances and sidecuts that work with a woman's unique physiology and biomechanics for more east-of-use, control, and fun. Exclusive Rocker combines varying heights of tip and tail rocker with camber underfoot for enhanced performance and less fatigue in all snow conditions. 3D wood core construction delivers powerful grip and energy transmission through its thicker core profile. Autodrive blends vertical sidewall and cap constructions for superior edge hold combined with comfortable turn transitions. The vertical sidewalls underfoot provide increased power and edge grip. The Dynastar Exclusive Idyll is a gem of a ski that's going to help you slay the whole mountain.",
