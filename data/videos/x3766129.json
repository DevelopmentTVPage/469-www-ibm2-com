At 88mm underfoot you get the great mix of stability and float in the ungroomed and a medium turn radius when it is time for you to fly down some groomers. The All Mountain Rocker has 15% rocker in the tip to keep the tips floating, absorb vibrations caused by bumps or crud, and engage the edge of the ski quicker on the hard pack. The other 85% of the ski has traditional camber that gives the Crimson Ti stability and grip as you blow past other people on the groomers. The Wood Core with a Titanal Insert keeps the ski stable at fast speeds so you will always have a predictable turn and great feel for the snow. The Step Down Sidewalls have a half cap construction on the tips and tails to keep the ski light, and increase the durability. The sidewall underfoot improves the dampening of vibrations, and will drive a solid edge when things get firm. If you are a strong skier who likes a ski that can be both damp and powerful, yet snappy and responsive in any snow condition, the Atomic Nomad Crimson will make you see red.",
