The Youngblood DoubleDog is the more aggressive version of the Youngblood. The DoubleDog profile brings camber sections under each foot for added power and pop, while rocker between the feet and in the nose and tail makes the whole thing forgiving and damn fun. Toss in Booter Boosters to take your style to a higher, poppier level. Get weird, make up some new rail tricks, pop and ollie and have fun. To add to the awesome the Youngblood comes with the sintered Formula Base. Speak loud, ride hard and be heard. DoubleDog dare you.",
