The Cloud series has gone through some improvements this season such as the addition of Step Down Sidewall 2.0, and the ARC Binding System. The ARC System improves the torsional strength of the ski, has good vibration dampening properties and most importantly gives the Cloud Nine a very even and natural flex. Step Down Sidewall 2.0 Construction has a sidewall underneath the binding platform for edge grip on the snow, and cap construction on the tip and tail for forgiveness and easy turning. The Cloud Nine is also made with Atomic's Piste Rocker which has 90% of the ski is traditionally cambered for spring and rebound, and the front 10% has slight tip rocker for quick turn initiation. If you are looking for a quick turning ski for the intermediate skier who will only be on the groomed trails, the Atomic Cloud Nine ARC will be a solid choice.",
