Blizzards 3D Flipcore has a very powerful, yet surfy feel that makes the Bodacious very easy to ski on any type of snow condition. The core has layers of wood, with titanium that feels very damp and powerful enough to blow through any crud, chunder or gaper that may get in the way of your descent, but a layer of bamboo adds a special touch of playfulness, that makes the Bodacious easy to maneuver in tight chutes or trees. This ski knows no speed limit, and loves to be tested to see how fast it will go. If you are looking for a ski that a stick of dynamite wont make it chatter, the Blizzard Bodacious is a ski for you.",
