If you've been fueling sufficiently, and you're still struggling to go the distance, you're likely dealing with insufficient endurance or stamina. \n\nTraining to build up stamina\n\nIf you're working on a new distance goal (e.g., you're graduating from half-marathons to full marathons), you'll need to build up stamina. By increasing both endurance and strength you'll improve stamina. The first half of stamina training is to put in the days and train at a lower intensity for longer time. Gradual increases are the most effective way to increase endurance. Aim for a 10% increase in mileage or duration per week. The second half of stamina training is to cross-train for strength. \n\nCaffeine for stamina \n\nSupport your endurance training with a little pre-workout caffeine\u2014known for enhancing endurance performance. Choose a holistic stimulant such as green tea or yerba mat\u00e9.\nTo learn how the Vega Sport Nutrition System supports all stages of your workout, check out VegaSport.com.",
