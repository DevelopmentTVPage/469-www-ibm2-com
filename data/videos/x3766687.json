The Quickrip Sidecut technology lets the board ride loose and playful at slow speeds, and powerful and precise at higher speeds. Bambooster technology is a center milled, eco-friendly, bamboo rods inserted under the bindings and out towards the nose and tail for an earth friendly response. Glass V Stringer technology radiates from the binding region to the contact points for added pop and edge control. Throw in Mtnpop Rocker between the feet with positive camber in the nose and tail to deliver a fine blend of powder float, freestyle playfulness, and all-mountain power pop. The Factory Rocker comes with a Pop Core Matrix which is smooth flexing that kicks back energy when you lay into it.",
