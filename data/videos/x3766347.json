Made for the athletic intermediate or the expert that enjoys skiing everything the mountain has to offer. At 80mm underfoot the SuperGlide is wide enough to take on the bowls and trees, when there is some fresh snow, but not too wide that turning on the groomers feels cumbersome. Built with K2s All Terrain Rocker (rocker in the tip with camber underfoot) the SuperGlide is at home in any snow condition. Tip Rocker helps the ski float and stay on top of the snow in powder, initiate turns quicker on the groomers, and absorb some of the negative vibrations that are caused by bumps or crud. The Bioflex 2 Core has a 70\/30 ratio of Aspen to Paulownia wood that gives the ski a lower swing weight, without sacrificing any strength. The K2 Mod Monic and Mod Technology keep the SuperGlide nice and stable when you start pushing the speed limit. The new K2 SuperGlide is a great ski for the athletic intermediate or the expert that is not afraid to go anywhere on her home mountain, trees, groomers, bumps and bowls she can glide over them all.",
