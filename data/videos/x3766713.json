The Carbon Credit is an awesome, fun ride and comes with the wide size for those with the big feet. The Carbon Credit BTX comes with Banana rocker is an all mountain freestyle snowboard and is good for all skill levels. With a mid-level flex and Banana rocker that pops like no other the Carbon Credit BTX is best for all mountain cruising and spring-time park ventures. Constructed with the Mervin Sustainable woodcore with sandwich construction and Bi-axial glass makes this a lightweight board that is ready to take a beating. The Banana Magnetraction gives you better edge control and makes for an easier ride and will rip the hardpack, kill the jibs and float powder unbelievably. Transworld Snowboarding Good Wood Winner for 2013, if you refuse to believe, try it out for yourself.",
