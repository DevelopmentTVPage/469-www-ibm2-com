The Forum Scallywag maybe! This Snowboard transforms the entire mountain into your own terrain park. With Forums ChillyDog with Pop you get the forgiving feel of the rocker but without loosing any pop. While cruising down the hill on the way to the park, the Scallywag can pop and jib off of any random feature with ease. By reducing material in the nose and tail the Swingers Club Technology offers quick smooth spins without affecting the integrity of the boards core. The slick and rugged FreeBase base is easy to repair if you find yourself cruising down the sidewalk or jibbing boulders. Now grab the Scallywag and become your local hills pirate that steals all the best lines while screaming aaarrrggghhhh in mid-air. The Forum Scallywag Snowboard has a Chillydog Rocker.",
