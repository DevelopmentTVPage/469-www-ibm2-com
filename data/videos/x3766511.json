At 96mm underfoot the Aura is happy anywhere you can take her, wide open bowls, trees, and empty groomers. The Power Construction is the very same that Volkl uses in all of their race skis for superior edge grip and stability. The Sensorwood Light core is snappy and powerful, for ultimate control over your skis. The tip rocker on the Aura will engage turns quickly edge to edge, deflect the negative vibrations caused by bumps and crud, and help the ski plane on top of powder. A layer of titanium makes the Aura super strong laterally and torsionally, for a strong feel. If you are looking for a womens ski that is just as strong and powerful than most mens skis on the market, that you can take anywhere, the Volkl Aura is the ski for you.",
