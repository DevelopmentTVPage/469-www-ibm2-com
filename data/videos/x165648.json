The major storyline traces the journeys of Dr. T. Colin Campbell, a nutritional biochemist from Cornell University, and Dr. Caldwell Esselstyn, a former top surgeon at the Cleveland Clinic.  The idea of food as medicine is put to the test.  Throughout the film, cameras follow \"reality patients\" who have chronic conditions from heart disease to diabetes.  Doctors teach these patients how to adopt a whole foods plant-based diet as the primary approach to treat their ailments -- while the challenges and triumphs of their journeys are revealed.  Brian Wendel is the Creator and Executive Producer and Lee Fulkerson is the Writer and Director.
