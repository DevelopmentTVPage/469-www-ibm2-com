The result is the new Squad 7. The Squad 7 has the time tested powder turn rocker profile, with 50% tip and tail low rocker and 50% high camber underfoot. The biggest innovation for the Squad 7 is the wider and stiffer tail, to give you more power at the end of your turn, more breaking power and more stability if you land on your tails after a giant cliff huck. If you enjoy going as fast as you can, and making as few turns possible, if any the Rossignol Squad 7 will crush anything you put in front of it.",
