At 96mm underfoot you get that perfect waist width that can float in all but chest deep powder, and still is carveable on the groomers. The Alibi has a titanium backbone inlayed into the wood core that will provide you with snap, power and stability. The All Mountain Rocker has 20% tip rocker to keep you floating, 65% camber underfoot to give you edge hold on the groomers, and in between the bumps, and 15% rocker in the tail to release you out of turns, and help you smear turns in pow. Atomic's Step Down Sidewall Construction has vertical sidewalls underfoot for a firm grip on the snow, and cap construction in the tips and tails that will make the Alibi very maneuverable in the tight trees. The Twin Progressive Sidecut has a longer radius in the tip for quicker turns, and a shorter radius in the tail to give you grip at the end of your turns. When the weather is perfect, ditch work and come up with your perfect ski, the Atomic Alibi.",
