This bully will watch your back, it won't steal your lunch money, or your homework. The Forum Bully has a twin-like shape and DoubleDog profile that mixes rocker and camber. With a stiffer tail the Bully will load up and launch you into the air with massive ollie power. Swingers Club reduces the swing weight of the Bully making spin faster in the air. With the Bully you'll be able to snake lines, poach kickers and one uping anyone who thinks there board is better then yours. The Forum Bully just became your new best friend.",
