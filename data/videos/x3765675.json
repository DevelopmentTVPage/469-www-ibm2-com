Now with a fully rockered profile the Mantra is more maneuverable than ever before. With a wider waist width at 100mm the Mantra has even better soft snow performance. More rocker in the tip will give you better floatation in the soft snow, and the rocker in the tail will help you smear turns and dump speed easier. The Mantra is still built with Volkl's strongest materials, and toughest construction. The Power Construction is the same that is used in the entire high performance Racetiger Line, to give you powerful edge grip on the snow, a very damp feel, an unmatched stability at ultra high speeds. A layer of Titanium only adds to the beefiness of the Mantra. If you are looking for a ski that knows no speed limit, is highly versatile and one of the best selling skis ever, it's time for you to try the ski that started the one ski does it all revolution many years ago, the all new Volkl Mantra.",
