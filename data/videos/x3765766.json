The 88XTi uses Elan's Force Wood with titanium laminates that give you power and strength as you blast your way down the mountain making short to medium radius turns. The Amphibio Rocker which is unique only to Elan's skis has a rockered outside edges for quick and easy turn initiation while the cambered inside edges give you a solid grip on the snow, and a sweet blend of maneuverability and stability. The Waveflex Technology has waves throughout the body of the ski that gives the 88XTi a natural and easy flex, and a high torsional strength, without adding any extra weight. SST Sidewalls are slanted to drop some more pounds off of the ski, but still drive a strong edge on the firm snow. If you want a ski that will turn easily, make very clean carves, and be stable no matter how fast you can push it the Elan Amphibio 88 Xti is the ski for you.",
