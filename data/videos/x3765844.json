All-Mountain Rocker Technology features moderate tip and tail rocker which enable easier turn initiations and superior soft snow performance. 3D wood core construction is a thicker core profile at edges which provides powerful grip and energy transmission. Super Fiber is basalt and aramide fibers woven into fiberglass for increased strength and rebound giving you that nice snap out of turns. Super Fiber also absorbs vibrations and increases ski-snow contact so you can rip it like a boss. Autodrive is a blend of vertical sidewall and cap constructions for superior edge hold combined with comfortable turn transitions. The Dynastar Outland 80 is the epitome of an all-mountain ski.",
