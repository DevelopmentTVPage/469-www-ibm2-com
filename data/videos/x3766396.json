The Jib Rocker has zero camber underfoot with slight tip and tail rocker that make slides, butters, and ollies much easier. The Park Flex Pattern has softer tips and tails, and stays stiff underfoot for stability when carving and tuning on the hard snow. A Triaxial Braided Cap Construction is lightweight and forgiving, just for the mellow skier. An Aspen Wood Core provides the Press with lots of pop, and spring, and has a low swing weight so your first 3 can easily turn in to your first 5, then even your first 7. The Press has a Directional Taper that will always keep you heading in the right direction, even if you are skiing switch or not. K2 has added some Tip and Tail Hardware to the Press for added durability so you do not have to worry about blowing your tip or tail apart when you have one of those nasty back slapper landings. If you are looking for a durable, inexpensive twin tip for the mellow park skier the K2 Press is your ski.",
