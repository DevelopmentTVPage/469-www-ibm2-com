The version of 1901 is a spin off of Birdy! This is actually live and then I went back and added another acoustic track and harmony on the chorus! PLEASE keep spreading the word guys, I can't tell you all how much that does for my career. YOU are all the reason I am getting any recognition. So, THANK YOU.\n\nwww.macymaloy.com\n@macymariemaloy",
