Velocity is a carving ski in the new Rox line from K2. This carving ski is perfect for the intermediate to advanced skier who enjoys lightning quick short radius turns on the groomers. The new Rox Technology has the Mod Suspension system that is a layer that sits on top of the primary core that acts independently so it does not affect the overall flex of the ski. That means that you can get a ski to flex easily and natural without being overly stiff and demanding. The Velocity also has the Carbon Web that is a raised X-shaped pattern further away from the core, which gives the ski stronger torsional strength, for better edge grip, without changing the longitudinal flex of the ski. Speed rocker is also added to the new Velocity that gives the ski a quicker, more precise turn, and a smoother ride when the groomers can get a little firm, or bumpy. The Marker M3 binding system gives the ski an even flex, and is 20% lighter than previous models. The Velocity is 72mm underfoot and with a 15m (@172cm) is extremely quick edge to edge. If you enjoy short radius turns, and a perfect day for you is short radius turns, at medium to fast speeds the new K2 Velocity would be a great ski for you.",
