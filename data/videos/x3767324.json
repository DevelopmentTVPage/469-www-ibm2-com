A great ski for women who want to destroy the entire mountain. At 96mm underfoot she is wide enough to surf and smear in the untracked snow, but quick and stable enough to rip up medium to long radius turns on the groomers. Rossi's Powder Turn Rocker is a blend of tip and tail rocker with camber underfoot floats on top of the powder, and gives you great edge grip on the hard pack. Rossignol's WRS (Weight Reduction System) maximizes the skis durability and reduces the overall weight by 400 grams. A Centered Sidecut has a deep radius for edge grip and power underfoot, while the short length of sidecut makes the ski steer easier and very playful. The Rossignol S3 Womens is a great ski for women who want to take on any condition with power and control.",
