At 80mm underfoot the Rictor can carve on the groomers, float when the snow gets deep, and be stable in variable snow. Hybritech Sidewalls give you edge grip on firm snow and ice. All Terrain Rocker profile Rictor will improve control in all snow conditions. Tip rocker helps you engage turns quicker on hard pack, float better in powder, and give a smoother ride in variable snow. An Aspen and Paulownia wood core has a metal laminate that gives the Rictor the lateral and torsional power to take on any condition that you will find out there. The Mod Monic Dampening System is a zinc mass that is placed on the shovel of the ski to absorb negative vibrations that you get from skiing fast on groomers, or from variable snow. The Rictor has been a best seller since its inception, and is a perfect ski for the Midwest, Back East, or the Rockies. If you have been looking for a ski that is versatile enough to take on a powder day, blaze to groomers, or cruise off trail when it has not snowed in a while, the K2 Rictor will jump up and down rapidly to answer the call.",
