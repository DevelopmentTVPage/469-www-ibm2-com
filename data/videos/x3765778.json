The 78mm waist is very quick edge to edge. The Amphibio Rocker has a rockered outside edge and a cambered inside edge to give you a ski that is extremely easy to turn, but very stable, especially at short to medium radius turns. RST Sidewalls deliver power right to the edges of the ski for unmatched edge hold. A Power Wood Core with a single layer of titanium has the perfect mixture of liveliness and dampness, for a ski that can makes clean and concise carves at medium to fast speeds. Loaded with features the Amphibio 78 Ti also has Elan's Waveflex Technology that has waves across the top sheet of the ski to lower weight, give you a high torsional strength, and make the overall weight of the ski lower. If you want a ski that turns and corners like it is on rails the Amphibio 78 Ti is the perfect ski for you.",
