The Women Stance is 8mm forward from the traditional mounting point of the ski to help the ladies to initiate turns quicker and easier. All Terrain Rocker makes the Lava more maneuverable and easier for you to control as you make your way down the mountain. Salomon's Double Monocoque Construction is very lively and snappy, that gives you a forgiving ride that will be perfect for the not very aggressive skier to make short to medium radius turns. The Powerline Active Dampening System will smooth out any of the negative vibrations that can be caused by variable snow conditions. If you are looking for a ski that will be easy to control, and enjoys making smooth and easy turns on the groomers the Salomon Lava will be a great ski for you.",
