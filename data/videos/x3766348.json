The speed rocker is slight tip rocker that will help engage the ski quicker and easier than ever before. The Bioflex 3 Core with metal laminate, 80% Aspen and 20% Paulownia is the strongest womens specific core that K2 offers. At 72mm underfoot and a 12 meter (@160cm) turning radius the SuperBurnin is super quick edge to edge and love all turn shapes on the groomers, as long as the driver is strong and confidant. The Hybritech sidewalls add even more toughness to the construction, and better edge grip on the firm snow and ice. If you enjoy burning down the groomers at medium to fast speeds, in a variety of turn shapes take the K2 SuperBurnin for a spin, you wont be disappointed.",
