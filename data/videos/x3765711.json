At 88mm underfoot the Black Pearl can float in light powder, fly down through the bumps, and be very maneuverable for short to medium radius turns on the groomers. A solid wood core with a Bamboo Layer has a damp feeling with a touch of snap. The Bamboo gives the Black Pearl it's snap, and helps reduce some weight. The Flipcore 3D Rocker is made by placing the wood in the press upside down, to keep a solid, damp feeling when you reach your top speed for an ultra stable ride. Vertical Sidewalls give the Black Pearl a strong torsional strength for a strong grip on the snow with every turn. If you are looking for a powerful ski that will go anywhere you can take it the Blizzard Black Pearl will be a perfect ski for you.",
