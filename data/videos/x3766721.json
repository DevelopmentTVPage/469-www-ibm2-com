Banana technology between your feet for easy riding and catch free freestyle fun in park. Magnatraction along the sidewalls help create more contact points on the snow allowing maximum control. The Park Pickle has asymmetrical sidecuts which means your heel side sidecut is much deeper then toe side sidecut allowing the Park Pickle to be asymmetrical just like your body. Hand built using eco friendly wood and environmentally friendly constructions. The GNU Park Pickle is the most fun you will have with your clothes on this year.",
