At 90mm underfoot the Celebrity 90 falls into that not too wide not too skinny all mountain category. She can carve and turn on the groomers, and float through powder. The Early Rise in the tip and tail will help you engage a turn with ease, and prevent your tips from sinking when the snow starts to pile up, while the camber underfoot will give you plenty of drive and power when you need it. The Line Composite Matrix gives the Celebrity 90 the lateral and torsional strength for a medium to aggressive skier, without adding extra weight to the ski, so your legs will be nice and fresh when it is time to cut up a rug on the dance floor for the apr\u00e8s ski party, just make sure to take your ski boots off. The Line Celebrity 90 is the go to ski for gals that like to do it all, get yours today.",
