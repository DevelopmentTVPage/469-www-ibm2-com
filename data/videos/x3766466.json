At 105mm underfoot the Influence prefers to spend most of its time in deep snow and ungroomed terrain. The Line Metal Matrix give the Influence all of the power and control that skis with edge to edge metal have with out adding excessive weight. 65cm of Early Rise in the tip will help this bad boy float in all the pow, and smooth out your ride when it has been some time between storms. The 32cm of Early Rise in the tail will help make you smear your turns as you float through the forest looking for freshies. Line's Fatty Base Edge give the Influence 105 a 30% thicker base that helps repel core shots from nasty pre-season conditions, buried rocks, and lengthens the tuning life of your new skis. if you enjoy going big, fast and strait the Line Influence 105 is a ski for you, if you are tough enough for it.",
