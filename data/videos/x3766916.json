Inspired by surfboard shapers that feel that powder acts like a 3 dimensional medium, similar to water, the BBR 8.9 has an ultra wide V shaped shovel that can not sink, no matter how deep the snow. Salomon is looking to give you the maximum sensation under your feet. The 147mm tip gives you more feel, and the narrower (89mm) under your the better the grip. An Oversized Pulse Pad Dampening System has an elastomer layer along the whole edge and shovel of the ski, provides maximum shock absorption and smoother ski to snow contact. The BBR 8.9 has a very surfy feel, no matter what the conditions are, deep powder, crud, or groomers. Total Edge Reinforcement increased durability against rocks or coral that might be under the frozen water. Vertical Sidewalls add some carving ability to this unique shape. The BBR 8.9 is a perfect ski for someone who is looking for a powder ski that is under 90mm underfoot. Don't be afraid to surf the mountain on this new ski shape.",
