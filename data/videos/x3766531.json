At 95mm under foot the Bridge can handle all but the deepest powder, yet still be quick edge to edge for quick turns on the groomers. The Multi-Layer Sensorwood core, is the same construction that Volkl uses in their race skis, that will give you fantastic edge grip, stability, and a smooth ride. The carbon layer in the ski gives it lots of strength and power, without adding too much extra weight. The Bridge's Extended Low Profile (ELP) rocker profile makes the ski extremely maneuverable in powder and soft snow, while on the hard pack you get consistent edge contact along the entire edge of the ski, making medium to long radius turns very clean and powerful. A great ski for the East Coast, Midwesterner, or the Westerner who does not want an ultra wide ski, the Volkl Bridge has unmatched versatility.",
