His all mountain tool returns again as the Line Sir Francis Bacon. At 108mm under foot the Bacon as it is known, can float in all but the deepest powder, kill it when it hasn't snowed in a few days, and jam on the hard pack when you need it to. The Early Rise tip and tail will float, turn, carve and smear in any condition imaginable. Full vertical side walls give the Bacon grip in the spring time when you are up early and there is a vicious freeze thaw cycle, or any other time when things get firm. The Line Thin Tip is now lower and lighter than other manufactures design, for a lower swing weight, for huge misty 7's off of your secret backcountry booter. The Early Taper side cut makes the Bacon less hooky in heavy or wet snow. If all mountain versatility is what you have been looking for, try Eric Pollards personal stash, the Line Sir Francis Bacon.",
