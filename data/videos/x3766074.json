Salomon's Powder Rocker is maneuverable in the trees and stable when you are flashing lines down an empty wide open bowl. A full wood core with a twin tip and tail make the Rocker 92 light, and stable. The Pulse Pad is an elastomer layer along the edge to dampen vibrations as you power though sick pillow lines in the trees. Wider edges, and total edge reinforcement are a must for added durability to reduce the chances of blowing an edge out when the cheese grater andicite is buried under a layer of the fresh stuff. When first tram is the norm, not a special occasion have the Salomon Rocker 92 on your feet.",
