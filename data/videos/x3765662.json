The Full Rocker Profile gives the RTM 80 lots of maneuverability. Tip rocker eases turn initiation, and the rocker in the tail releases you out of turns very quickly. Volkl's Dual XTD Transmission Construction has beefed up wood over the edges of the ski that improves the torsional strength, and gives you a powerful grip on the snow. A layer of steel over the core provides a damp feeling, and has the ability to motor through variable conditions. The RTM 80 uses the Marker\/Volkl iPT Wideride binding system that has a wider mounting platform for direct power transfer from your boots, through your binding's right to your skis. If want a ski that hauls down the groomers, at any speed, with power the Volkl RTM 80 will be a great ski for you.",
