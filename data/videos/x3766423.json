Then you have found your Soulmate. The new line Soulmate is a perfect ski that can charge the entire mountain with the best of them. At 98mm underfoot and a nice blend of Early Rise in the tip and tail, with camber underfoot, the Soulmate can float through the powder, blow through crud, and rail some nice turns on the groomers. The Line Metal Matrix is a Titanal laminate that gives the Soulmate power and stability where you want it without adding the extra weight. The Aspen Macro Block wood core is a perfect mix of stability and pop. If you like a ski that can do it all, powder, groomers and crud look no further than your perfect Soulmate.",
