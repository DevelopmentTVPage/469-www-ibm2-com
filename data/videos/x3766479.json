The symmetrical flex make the Mastermind an easy skiing ski when you want to flip around and ski or land switch. The 5 Cut Side Cut adapts well to all turn shapes, and skill levels. The Early Rise tip will help you engage a turn better on the groomers, and the Early Rise tail will give you a little pop in the tail for hitting kickers, releasing you out of a turn quicker, and popping on top of boxes and rails. Fatty Base Edge gives this little guy a 30% thicker and stronger base for increased durability, and a longer tuning life. The Line Mastermind is a perfect ski for the tween or the mellow park skier.",
