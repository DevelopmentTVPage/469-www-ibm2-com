This Nordica ski is totally gnarly in design and decked out with some wicked awesome graphics. Its Energy Ca construction helps ensure stability all over. It's a big mountain ski so you can take El Paco anywhere. Speed down the groomers, ski the side country or have some playtime in the park. Powder to your waist or pipes of all sorts, these skis are for you. The Early Rise camRock pulls the traditional contact point of the tip back about 25% giving you a slight tip rocker. This boosts your floatation, velocity and maneuverability. Designed for all sorts of conditions, the Nordica El Paco Skis are fun for the skiers who embrace what the entire mountain has to offer.",
