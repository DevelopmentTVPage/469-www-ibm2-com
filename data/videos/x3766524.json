Built with the Multi-Layer Sensorwood Core (vertically laminated poplar and beech wood) the Kink has tons of spring and power for jumps, rails, and killing it in the park. The power\/tough box construction is the same that Volkl uses in its race skis, so you know its going to give you lots of grip and stability. The Carbon layer in the Kink will give you torsional, and lateral power without adding excessive weight. The tip and tail rocker with camber underfoot profile is new to Volkl's park and pipe line up as well. Tip rocker will help you enter a turn easier, tail rocker will help you exit a turn easier, and camber underfoot will give you pop and stability. The Kink from Volkl brings a new shape, and rocker profile to the table for Volkl's park and pipe scene, get one will you still can.",
